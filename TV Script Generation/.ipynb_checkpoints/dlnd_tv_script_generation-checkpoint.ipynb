    "**Answer:** \n",
    "1. First Hyperparameters were chosen to match the Sentiment RNN network used in the previous exercise - this seemed like a sensible starting point on the basis that both models are RNNs with the Adam optimizer. The difference in critereon was noted.:\n",
    "        1. LR = 0.01\n",
    "        2. embedding & hidden dims = 128\n",
    "        3. 2 layers in LSTM\n",
    "        \n",
    "2. Training was taking a while, so the batch size was increased to `50 -> 200`. This sped things up, but after 5/10 epochs, the loss was still above 4. Also learning rate halved to `0.005`, after seeing multiple forum posts with `0.001` (tried a lower value of `0.005` first, rather than just going straight for the `0.001` value seen)\n",
    "3. The embedding_dim, hidden_dim were changed `(128,128) -> (256, 512)`. This significantly slowed training back down again.\n",
    "4. embedding_dim, hidden_dim reeled back: `(256, 512) -> (200, 300)` to speed up training, but training loss still not in desired range.\n",
    "5. Embedding dims changed again, `(200,300) -> (400,600)`, while also changing the sequence length to 5. This allowed a much larger pair of dimensions, while training time remained reasonable.\n",
    "6. Epochs `10 -> 20`. Training loss was still decreasing after 10 epochs (almost at 3.5 goal), so allowed 20 epochs\n",
    "7. Before re-running, experiemented with lowering learning rate again `0.005 -> 0.001`. Wanted to speed up training on this experiment so changed embedding dims back to previous values. `(200,300) -> (400,600)`.\n",
    "8. This ran fast & gave impressive results quickly. Used this as an oppotunity to changed sequence length `5->7`\n",
    "9. Final model chosen was the latest given parameters above. The learning rate of `0.001` seemed to be the pivotal change here. The final change was epochs `20 -> 10` as when 20 was used, the loss stopped decreasing after 8-9 epochs. Testing loss was not analysed in this piece of work, but it would not be a surprise if testing loss started increasing as the model continued into epochs 10-20. \n",
